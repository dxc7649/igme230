<p id="verse1">Mad has decided to catch a vulture,<br>
the biggest bird she can find.<br></p>
 
<p id="verse2">She is so determined, and so inventive,<br>
that by stringing together a rickety trap<br>
of ropes and sticks, she creates<br>
a puzzling structure that just might<br>
be clever enough to trick a buzzard,<br>
once the trap’s baited with leftover pork<br>
from supper.</p>
 
<p id="verse3">Mad and I used to do everything together,<br>
but now I need a project all my own,<br>
so I roam the green fields,<br>
finding bones.</p>
 
<p id="verse4">The skull of a wild boar.<br>
The jawbone of a mule.</p>
 
<p id="verse5">Older cousins show me<br>
how to shake the mule’s quijada,<br>
to make the blunt teeth<br>
rattle.</p>
 
<p id="verse6">Guitars.<br>
Drums.<br>
Gourds.<br>
Sticks.</p>
 
<p id="verse7">A cow bell.<br>
A washboard.<br>
Pretty soon, we have<br>
a whole orchestra.</p>
 
<p id="verse8>"On Cuban farms, even death<br>
can turn into<br>
music.</p>
