                In order to think and finish this design, I first draw out several sketches on paper that I think will
                be excellent to present my choice of Social Issue, which is "Children in the milltary". Then I choose
                the one that I think is the best among all of them and expand more ideas based on this specifc desgin.
                Finally, I pick the final solution for my design and start making it on Adobe Illustrator.
            </p>

            <p>
                My final design includes a combination of type and imagery, which the main goal is be attractive and
                maintains readability at the same time. In addition, I used some symbolic imageries to develop a
                intended message that is able to engages wiht my auidence, provides information, convinces them to
                think from my point of view and take corrsponding actions that I provide.
