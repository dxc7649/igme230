            <p>
                Through my anticipation, I think people that will be using my site includes Co-op/Full time employers,
                other students and professors who are browsing and trying to find out problems. I consider Co-op/Full
                time employers as one of the main audience because this portfolio site I create will not only be a way
                to show what I am capable to do, but also it is an actual example to show off what can I create. 
            </p>

            <p>
                After consider my intended audiences, I decided that I will have one landing page and three individual pages
                to display my projects (documentation page does not includes in here). For the landing page, the original plan
                is to keep the existed layout and only make some small changes, such as remove the "portfolio" dropdown menu and
                make each circle a clickable link to the individual page, make it a grid layout and so on. However, as I try to 
                manage through three circles, I found out it is hard to cooperate them into my new grid layout. THerefore, I 
                abondon the original desgin and instead to use rounded rectangle, which is eaiser to manage and accomplish druing 
                the short amount of work times. 
            </p>

            <p>
                For the indiviudal page, I change the whole layout from a singe column to two columns, which makes the description of
                the project to the left, and the picture of the project to the right. In addition, I removed the original dropdown menu 
                and make the title of each individual page to a dropdown menu using jQuery. However, the whole design of the individual p
                page is a little bit rough due to the short amount of working time I have (change to redo the portfolio near the due date). 
                As for this documentation page, I made a link from the landing page that will directly link to here. Except that, the whole 
                gird layout of this page still remain the same as the previous one. 
            </p>

            <p>
                However, I am unable to make a printer-friendly resume to my portfolio. I spent three days trying to understand how to make a 
                printer-friendly resume by reading through the website with little success. In addtion, my original idea for this final project 
                is "Interactive Website", but I changed my idea to redo the portfolio near the end of due date. Therefore, I have to spent time 
                for a new grid layout and what should be improved from the old portfolio, which makes the time to learn how to make a 
                printer-friendly resume becoem short. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Except all these changes I made from the original portfolio, the rest of the desgin still remain pretty similart to the original. 
                I am able to understand how grid layout actually work and design the first successful layout for my website. In addition, even though 
                there is still some confusion when I try to code, I begin to undersatnd most of my own codes and codes from other resources, such as 
                "How To - Portfolio Gallery" from w3schools and the making of circle (eventhough at the end I decided to abondon the circle design). 
                However, although I can understand and begin to make few successful attempt in coding, I still have many parts I need to learn, such
                as what codes will influence which parts of website and why this code is useless under specific circumstance. Generaly, this final result
                for my new portfolio is not the best of my effort due to the lack of time but I put the most effort and energy into this project.
