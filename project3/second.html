                For this class project to design a poster, the first thing I had to do is choose the designer I want to
                present: William Morris. Then the hardest part come in, which is to think about a desgin that is able
                to both effectively present important informations of this "lecture" and provides certain knowledges
                about the
                designer that is going to have the "lecture". The final result was created through Adobe Illustrator.
            </p>

            <p>
                During the designning process, I first came up with sveral sketches that are able to present my idea.
                However, during the conversation with my professor, some of my designes were very unprofessional and
                ineffective from a viewer's point of view. Finally, my professo and I decided to use the following
                design.
