                Hotel LaBonte is a historic hotel in Douglas, Wyoming, United States. Built in 1913-1914, it was part of
                the town's early 20th century building boom, the result o fnew railroad and road connections. Local
                investors engaged the Baerresen Brothers of Cheyenne and Denver as architects, and contractor Edward Reavill erected teh
                three story brick structure. It had electrical lighting, steam heat and telephones in 54 guest rooms. THe U-shaped hotel
                is on a corner lot at the intersection of North Secondand Walnut Streets in downtown Douglas. Projecting wings facing Walnut
                Street flank a recessed courtyard that accommodates the hotel's entrance. The dining room occupies the ground floor of the east
                wing, and two storefronts occupy the west wing on the corner. The lobby has a tile floor, a beamed ceiling and decorative
                columns. Windows were replaced during renovations in 1967 and after a 1981 fire.
