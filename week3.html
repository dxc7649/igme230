                Hotel LaBonte is a historic hotel in Douglas, Wyoming, United States. Built in 1913-1914, it was part
                of the town's early 20th century building boom, the result o fnew railroad and road connections. Local
                investors engaged the Baerresen Brothers of Cheyenne and Denver as architects, and contractor Edward
                Reavill erected the three story brick structure. It had electrical lighting, steam heat and telephones in 54 guest rooms.
                THe U-shaped hotel is on a corner lot at the intersection of North Secondand Walnut Streets in downtown Douglas.
                Projecting wings facing Walnut Street flank a recessed courtyard that accommodates the hotel's entrance. The dining room occupies the
                ground floor of the east wing, and two storefronts occupy the west wing on the corner. The lobby has a tile floor, a beamed
                ceiling and decorative columns. Windows were replaced during renovations in 1967 and after a 1981 fire.<sup><a href="#ref2" id="ifn2">[2]</a></sup>

    <!--Here I will make an explanation about how this works: first I make the symbol "^" become a superscript. Then I make it a link so it can trace back to the in-text footnote 
    with id "ifn + number". Same process for the in-text footnote, just simply change the id it will back to from "ifn + number" to "ref + number" and make the whole in-text foornote
    a superscript-->
