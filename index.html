            Links to all class projects and in-class exercises will be in this page. Currently this page is simple and may not 
            be as good as others. However, as I learn more and more about how to build a responsive website, I will use the 
            knowledge I acquire to keep modify this page.
        </p>

        <h2><strong>In-class Exercises</strong></h2>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/dxc7649/igme230/tree/master/week3a/week3a.html">week3a</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/dxc7649/igme230/tree/master/week3b/week3b.html">week3b</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h2><strong>Class Projects</strong></h2>

        <p> &emsp; &ensp; This part will be replace with links for all class projects later on. For now, it will remain empty.</p>
