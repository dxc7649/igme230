                For this specfic class project, I used JavaScript, p5.js libaray and Brackets to creae a very simple game that
                allowed the user to control a character to move in four direction (left, right, up and down) around
                titles to change these titles in certain pattern. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This project is a “beginner” exercise for me to understand and how programming works. This is the very first time I 
                tried to deal with complex coding. It was a very big challenge for me due to the fact I never have any experience with JavaScript 
                and coding from before, and the final result of codes is also not perfect and still contains several mistakes that should be corrected. 
                However, from my knowledge of JavaScript now, I am able to successfully correct these mistakes and make the code better.
