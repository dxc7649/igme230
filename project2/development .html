            <p>
                During the process of making this project, I both design my own layout and modified several layouts
                from other sources. At the beginning when I try to code on my own for the gallery page (PORTFOLIO page), 
                I encountered many problems that I am not able to fix and the final result cannot match my own expectation. 
                After few terrible attemptes to code my own layout, I decided to take some part from other layouts. First, 
                I try to use the code from week six's exercise, but the end products after modification is not good and makes 
                the whole coding more complicated.
            </p> 
            
            <p>
                Finally, I choosed to use a layout from "How To - Portolio Gallery" of w3schools.com (Link to this website can 
                be founded below). I modified few things based on its layout. First, I deleted the whole section of "Some Other 
                Work" and replace it with four contance informations icons. Second, I edited the word "PORTFOLIO" to make it a 
                drop-down menu to navigates between different pages. In addition, instead of having four sections of my works, I 
                replace it with three circles that contains brief informations about three examples I am going to show. 
            </p>

            <p>
                For the rest three individual pages, I used the layout from week six's exercise about "holygrail-gird" and modified 
                it to match my expectation. First change is that I remove the whole navigation bar away because I will not put any navigation
                for this section. Instead, my navigation to other pages will be a "drop-down menu" button. Secondly, I removed the footer
                for same reason. I also modified the header so it will be the smae width as the combination of "article" and "aside".
            </p>

            <p>
                Through the process of doign this project, I do realized that even though I am able to finish the class exercise pretty effectively,
                I still cannot use all these knowledges I have into actual test. Sometimes I still cannot understand where should a specifc 
                code should be used. When I was lookign through html and css code from other sources, I begin to understand why my own codes were 
                not good enough and how other programmer approach wtih different solutions. For instance, when I tried to code css stylesheet for 
                my pages, I always find out that the result is not what I excepte I will get and I ususally cannot find anything wrong with my codes. 
                This makes me very frustrating becuase I know how each individual code works, but I cannot put them together.
